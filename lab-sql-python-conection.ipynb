    "In this lab, you will be working with the [Sakila](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/) database on movie rentals. Specifically, you will be practicing how to do basic SQL queries using Python. By connecting Python to SQL, you can leverage the power of both languages to efficiently manipulate and analyze large datasets. Throughout this lab, you will practice how to use Python to retrieve and manipulate data stored in the Sakila database using SQL queries. Let's get started!"
